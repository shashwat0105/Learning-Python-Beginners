Python is compiled as well as interpreted language

We can't use multidimensional array by importing array, here we use numpy

Python doesn't have pass by value or reference kind of thing unlike C++

4 types of Arguments
Position, Keyword, Default, Variable length (we use * here)

Functions are objects in Python
Know what is the difference between filter, reduce and map:

Lambda function are anonymous or nameless function

map: Takes a function f, and a list L1, and returns a list L2 obtained by applying f to every element of L1. 
Say f is a function that takes x and returns 2x. Then, map(f, [1,2,3,4]) returns [2,4,6,8].

filter: Takes a boolean function f and a list L1. 
It applies the function to each element of L1, and list of those elements that give true is returned.


reduce: Takes a binary operator f, a list L and a seed value (or identity element). 
It returns the seed value if the list is empty. Otherwise, it applies the binary operator f to the seed and first element of L, 
then applies f to the result of this and the 2nd element of L, and so on till L is exhausted. 
The result is returned. This can be seen as a generalization of factorial function.
i.e. Applies a given function to the iterables and returns a single value.


Class has 1) Attributes -> Variables 2) Behavior -> Methods(Functions)

Special :- 1) Special Variables __name__ 2) Special Methods __init__

Special operators
__add__(self, other) -> self + other
__sub__(self, other) -> self - other
__eq__(self, other) -> self == other
__lt__(self, other) -> self < other
__len__(self) -> len(self)
__str__(self) -> print self


Inner Class:-
You can create object of inner class inside the outer class 
        OR 
You can create object of inner class outside the object class privided you use the outer class name to call it.
